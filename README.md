# TailwindCSS easy responsive Layout
### React Vite / TailwindCSS _
Just an easy responsive design for a fictive bird web site, modified by me, inspired by Travery Media.

### This Website was created for learning purposes only.However, I did add some features to the original tutorial. I made a colour concept in Figma and created a background for the page.

**It does at the moment only contain a Landing Page.**
